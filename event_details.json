    "The TARDIS Connector Workshop 2025 is a collaborative event dedicated to advancing our understanding of stripped-envelope supernovae by leveraging the expertise and tools of the open science astrophysics community. This workshop will bring together specialists in atomic physics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics, and radiative transport to develop workflows that connect stellar evolution models to synthetic observables."

      "This workshop offers a unique opportunity for collaborative problem-solving rather than traditional presentations. Developers and contributors across different software teams (MESA, Flash-X, STELLA, and TARDIS) will work together to tackle the interfaces between the codes. Our aim is to produce a comprehensive model framework and reproducible recipes to address the physics needed for stripped-envelope supernovae simulation."
